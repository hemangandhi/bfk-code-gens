# bfk-gen

A brainfuck generator to print strings.

## Note for Rust pkg

This is just an old version here for my own satisfaction. It's (hopefully) much worse than the rust version.

The old algorithm was just to scale the GCD of all the ASCII. This is really useless, since that ASCII ordinals are within 26 of each other.
